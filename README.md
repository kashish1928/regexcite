# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of regexcite is to make regular expressions more exciting! It
provides convenience functions to make some common tasks with string
manipulation and regular expressions a bit easier.

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jennybc/regexcite")
```

## Usage

### 1. str_split_one

A fairly common task when dealing with strings is the need to split a
single string into many parts. This is what `base::strplit()` and
`stringr::str_split()` do.

``` r
(x <- "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta")
#> [1] "alfa,bravo,charlie,delta"
strsplit(x, split = ",")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
stringr::str_split(x, pattern = ",")
#> [[1]]
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
```

Notice how the return value is a **list** of length one, where the first
element holds the character vector of parts. Often the shape of this
output is inconvenient, i.e. we want the un-listed version.

That’s exactly what `regexcite::str_split_one()` does.

``` r
library(regexcite)

str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
#> [1] "alfa"    "bravo"   "charlie" "delta"
```

Use `str_split_one()` when the input is known to be a single string. For
safety, it will error if its input has length greater than one.

`str_split_one()` is built on `stringr::str_split()`, so you can use its
`n` argument and stringr’s general interface for describing the
`pattern` to be matched.

``` r
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",", n = 2)
#> [1] "alfa"                "bravo,charlie,delta"

y <- "192.168.0.1"
str_split_one(y, pattern = stringr::fixed("."))
#> [1] "192" "168" "0"   "1"
```

### 2. my_add

`my_add()` is a function that takes two numeric values as input and
returns their sum. It has a default value of 10 for the second input, so
in case only one paraemter is included it’ll add 10 to that parameter.

``` r
library(regexcite)

my_add(10)
#> [1] 20
my_add(5,2)
#> [1] 7
```

Now, in case you enter NA, it’ll return NA. Also for safety it’ll give
an error if one of the inputs is a string.

``` r
library(regexcite)

my_add(NA)
#> [1] NA
my_add("one")
#> [1] "One of your inputs is a string"
```
